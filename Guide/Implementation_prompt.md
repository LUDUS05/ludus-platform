# LUDUS Platform Implementation Prompt (Updated - Curated MVP Approach)

## Context and Objective

You are tasked with implementing the LUDUS social activity discovery platform using a **curated MVP approach**. This means you will build a platform where administrators manually onboard high-quality vendors rather than building complex vendor self-registration systems from day one.

**Key Strategy Change**: Focus on perfecting the user experience first, with admin-curated, vetted vendors providing immediate value to users. Vendor self-service capabilities will be added in Phase 2 once demand is proven.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Smart MVP Principles

1. **User-First Development**: Prioritize features that directly impact user experience
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Start with 15-20 carefully curated vendors rather than building for scale
3. **Rapid Validation**: Launch in 8 weeks to test core assumptions
4. **Evolution Path**: Build with clear upgrade paths to more complex features
5. **Modular Monolith**: Single application with well-organized modules for future microservices split

## Technical Architecture

### MVP Architecture (Simplified Stack)

**Frontend:**
- React.js (single web application)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Stripe Elements for payments

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js (single application)
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for authentication
- Multer + Cloudinary for image uploads

**Infrastructure:**
- Railway or Vercel for deployment (simpler than Google Cloud initially)
- MongoDB Atlas for database
- Stripe for payment processing
- Cloudinary for image storage and management

**Development Tools:**
- Nodemon for development
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code quality
- Postman for API testing
