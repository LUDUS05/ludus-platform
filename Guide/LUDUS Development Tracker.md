# LUDUS Development Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the LUDUS social activity discovery platform. It provides a structured way to monitor tasks, assign priorities, track completion status, and manage the overall development workflow.

## How to Use This Tracker
1. **Task Status**: Mark tasks as "Not Started", "In Progress", "Blocked", "Testing", or "Completed"
2. **Priority**: Assign priority as "High", "Medium", or "Low"
3. **Update regularly**: Review and update this document at least once per sprint/week
4. **Add notes**: Document important decisions, blockers, or dependencies
