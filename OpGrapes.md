## **üìã Executive Summary**

This document provides a complete implementation roadmap for **LUDUS LDS1.2**, codenamed **Project "OpGrapes"**. This version marks a significant evolution from V1, focusing on deep social integration, enhanced user engagement, and a robust administrative framework.

Key advancements in LDS1.2 include:

* **Enhanced Social Platform**: Full social media integration for login and sharing, user activity feeds, and community-building features.  
* **Geo-Map Discovery**: Interactive event discovery using the **Google Maps API**.  
* **Component-Driven UI**: A strict methodology using **shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook** to ensure a consistent and high-quality user interface.  
* **User Wallet & Credit System**: An in-app wallet for refunds and loyalty rewards.  
* **Community-Powered Rating System**: A mandatory participant rating system to ensure community quality and safety.  
* **Advanced User Personalization**: Granular control over user preferences, including language and participant gender.  
* **Hierarchical Admin System**: A structured team management system with defined roles and permissions.

## **üìñ Core Terminology**

To ensure clarity and consistency across the platform, the following terms are officially defined:

* **Partner**: Replaces the term "Vendor". Refers to any business, organizer, or individual offering services on the platform.  
* **Activity**: Refers to the **type** of engagement offered by a Partner. It is the "what".  
  * *Example: "Standard Bowling Game at Aspar Bowling in Riyadh."*  
* **Event**: Refers to a specific, scheduled instance of an Activity. It is the "when".  
  * *Example: "A 'Standard Bowling Game' event is scheduled for 9:00 PM \- 10:00 PM on August 17th, 2025."*

### **Approach for UI Consistency**

To guarantee a consistent, scalable, and high-quality UI system, a **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** methodology is mandated.

* **Core Technology**: All UI components will be built using **shadcn/ui** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This provides a robust and flexible foundation.  
* **Single Source of Truth**: **Storybook** will be implemented as the definitive library for all UI components. Every component (from a simple button to a complex card) **must** be developed, documented, and tested in isolation within Storybook before being integrated into the main application.  
* **Atomic Design Principles**: Components will be structured using Atomic Design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms). This ensures maximum reusability, simplifies development, and enforces visual consistency. For example, an Avatar (atom) and UserName (atom) can be combined to create a UserProfile (molecule).

## **üõ†Ô∏è CLI Agent System**

*(This section remains largely the same but will be updated to include generators for new features like Wallet components and Map views.)*

\# Development Commands for LDS1.2  
ludus dev:start                    \# Start development environment  
ludus dev:component \<name\>         \# Generate new component (and its Storybook file)  
ludus dev:page \<route\>             \# Generate Next.js page  
ludus dev:map-view \<name\>          \# Generate a new map-based view component  
ludus dev:wallet-ui \<component\>    \# Generate a new component for the Wallet feature

## **üìä Project Management Integration**

*(No changes to this section's structure. Sprints will be created in Linear/GitHub Projects based on the LDS1.2 phases.)*

## **üöß LDS Team Management System**

A hierarchical admin system is a priority for LDS1.2 to ensure secure and efficient platform management. The system will be built around AdminGroups and ModGroups with the following roles:

* **SA \- Super Admin**:  
  * **Authority**: Full, unrestricted access to all platform data, settings, and user accounts. The highest level of authority.  
* **Platform Manager**:  
  * **Responsibility**: Manages all public-facing content, including static pages (About Us, FAQ), promotional banners, and platform-wide announcements.  
* **Moderator**:  
  * **Responsibility**: Ensures community health. Can view and modify user data/profiles, review and act on flagged content (reviews, comments), and handle user-reported issues.  
* **Admin of Partnerships**:  
  * **Responsibility**: Manages the entire partnership team and has oversight of all Partner accounts.  
  * **PSM \- Partner Success Manager**:  
    * **Responsibility**: The primary point of contact for Partners. Responsible for activating new Partner accounts and managing the relationship. **Each Partner must be linked to 1 PSM.**  
  * **PSA \- Partner Success Associate**:  
    * **Responsibility**: Supports PSMs. Can add and modify Partner data, including creating and updating Activity listings and managing Event schedules.

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Social Booking and Rating Flow', () \=\> {  
  test('user can log in with Google, find event on map, book with wallet, and rate participants', async ({ page }) \=\> {  
    // 1\. Social Login  
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/login');  
    await page.click('button:has-text("Login with Google")');  
    // (mock Google auth flow)  
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/dashboard');

    // 2\. Find Event on Map  
    await page.click('a\[href="/map"\]');  
    await page.waitForSelector('.map-pin');  
    await page.click('.map-pin:first-child');  
    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Bowling');

    // 3\. Book with Wallet  
    await page.click('button:has-text("Book Now")');  
    await page.click('input\[name="paymentMethod"\]\[value="wallet"\]');  
    await expect(page.locator('.wallet-balance')).toContainText('Sufficient funds');  
    await page.click('button:has-text("Confirm Booking")');  
    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toContainText('Booking Confirmed');

    // 4\. Rate Participants (simulate post-event)  
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/dashboard/past-events');  
    await page.click('.event-card:first-child button:has-text("Rate Participants")');

    // Helper function to check for admin roles  
    function isRole(role) {  
      return isAuthenticated() && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.adminRole \== role;  
    }  
    function isAnyAdmin() {  
      return isAuthenticated() && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.adminRole \!= null;  
    }

    // Wallets can only be read by their owner or a Super Admin  
    match /wallets/{userId} {  
      allow read, write: if isOwner(userId) || isRole('SA');  
    }

    // Partner data can be modified by the Partner or relevant admin roles  
    match /partners/{partnerId} {  
      allow read: if true;  
      allow write: if isOwner(partnerId) || isRole('PSA') || isRole('PSM') || isRole('SA');  
    }  
      
    // User ratings can only be created by authenticated users who attended the event  
    match /ratings/{ratingId} {  
      allow create: if isAuthenticated() && hasAttended(request.resource.data.eventId);  
      allow read: if true;  
    }  
  }
