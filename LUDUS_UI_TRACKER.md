## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Architecture
```javascript
// Complete system architecture
const ludusUISystem = {
  theme: {
    provider: 'React Context API',
    persistence: 'localStorage + system preference',
    switching: 'class-based (Tailwind dark: prefix)',
    variables: 'CSS custom properties'
  },
  animations: {
    library: 'Framer Motion',
    performance: 'GPU acceleration + will-change optimization',
    accessibility: 'prefers-reduced-motion support',
    gestures: 'Multi-touch with drag/pinch/swipe'
  },
  effects: {
    glassMorphism: 'backdrop-filter + rgba backgrounds',
    parallax: 'Intersection Observer + transform',
    progressive: 'Lazy loading + blur-to-sharp transitions',
    interactions: 'Magnetic hover + spring physics'
  }
};
```

### Component Update Pattern
```jsx
// Standard pattern for theme-aware components
const Component = ({ ...props }) => (
  <div className="
    bg-white dark:bg-dark-bg-secondary
    text-charcoal dark:text-dark-text-primary
    border-warm dark:border-dark-border-secondary
    transition-colors duration-200
  ">
    {/* Component content */}
  </div>
);
```

### Color Mapping Strategy
| Light Theme | Dark Theme | Usage |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| `#FAFAFA` | `#0F0F0F` | Primary background |
| `#FFFFFF` | `#1A1A1A` | Card backgrounds |
| `#2B2B2B` | `#FFFFFF` | Primary text |
| `#FF6600` | `#FF7A1A` | Brand orange |
| `#EEEEEE` | `#404040` | Borders/dividers |
